title: "SPARRA"

This Quarto book is a demo of the SPARRA package.

First, we load the package from the local directory.

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(magrittr)
install.packages("../minisparra/", repos = NULL, type="source")
library(miniSPARRA01)
```

## Looking at the data

```{r}
make_lookup() %>% knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
make_raw_ae2() %>% knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
make_raw_smr00() %>% knitr::kable()
```

The following section is disabled for now because it relies on temporary files, and I don't want to edit the library right now.

```{r}
# clean_rawData_ae2() %>% knitr::kable()

# This is SMR00, we should probably change the function name
# clean_rawData() %>% knitr::kable()
```
