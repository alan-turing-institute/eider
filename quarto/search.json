MINISPARRA has N different transformation types, X, Y, and Z. The user specifies how the data will be grouped via grouping_columns, which in this case is grouping by patient ID.

The first subfilter - subfilter_1 specifies that the user wants to filter based on the attendance_category column of the random A&E-type data, and that the value that they are interested in is 1. That is only return results where the attendance_category is 1.\nThe second subfilter subfilter_2 filters based on the diagnosis_1 column and should only return results where diagnosis_1 is 101.\nAs the primary filter is AND, the resultant dataframe will be a count, grouped by patient id of A&E data with attendance_category = 1 AND diagnosos_1 = 101."
