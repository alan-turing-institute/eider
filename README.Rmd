**eider** is an R package for extracting machine learning features from tabular data, in particular health records, in a declarative manner.

Features are specified as JSON objects which contain all the necessary information required to perform a given calculation.
For example, the following calculates the number of total rows per patient `id` in the table labelled `ae2` (details on how to specify this table are in the function documentation).

```json
{
  "source_table": "ae2",
  "transformation_type": "COUNT",
  "grouping_column": "id",
  "absent_default_value": 0,
  "output_feature_name": "total_ae_attendances"
}
```

The output of this is a column named `total_ae_attendances`, containing the number of rows per patient, and with a value of 0 for any patients who do not appear in the `ae2` table.

This declarative approach provides an alternative to traditional, imperative-style, `dplyr` pipelines which can be more difficult to reason about, especially when a series of features is being extracted and merged together.
As features are specified without reference to a specific programming language or paradigm, it also encourages code that is concise, easy to read, and maintainable.

`eider` is a collaboration between [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), [Public Health Scotland](https://publichealthscotland.scot/), and the Universities of [Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk) and [Durham](https://www.durham.ac.uk).
It grew out of a desire to generalise the feature extraction process for health data, specifically the [SPARRA *(Scottish Patients At Risk of Readmission and Admission)* project](https://www.gov.scot/publications/sparra-made-easy/) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/jamesliley/SPARRAv4)), and to allow similar analyses to be carried out in different contexts.

## Installation

You can install `eider` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alan-turing-institute/eider")
```

We plan to submit `eider` to CRAN in the near future.

## Documentation

The package documentation is available [online](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/eider/).
In particular, the [package articles](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/eider/articles/) contain a series of vignettes which provide detailed guidance on the package and its features.

## Development

If you are making changes to the library itself, first clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:alan-turing-institute/eider.git
```

You will need to install the `lintr`, `pkgdown`, `devtools` R packages to build documentation, run tests, and lint.
Then, from the repository root, you can use the following commands:

- `make doc` generates all function documentation, and also generates the `README.md` file from `README.rmd`
- `make lint` lints the project directory
- `make test` runs all tests

You can also use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to run all of these before committing, to ensure that you do not commit incomplete code.
Firstly, install `pre-commit` according to the instructions on the webpage above.
Then run `pre-commit install`.

*What about vignettes?*
Well, building vignettes is slightly more complicated.
You can perform a one-time build from the R console using `pkgdown::build_site()`, but running this every time you edit a file gets tiring quickly.
To automate this, first install the package with `make install`, and install a working version of Python and also [`entr`](https://github.com/eradman/entr) (the latter is available on Homebrew via `brew install entr`).
Then run `make vig`: this will monitor your vignette RMarkdown files, rebuild the vignettes any time they are changed, and launch a HTTP server on port 8000 to view the files.
If you change any library code you will have to run `make install` again before rerunning `make vig`.
