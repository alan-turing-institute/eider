# Examples: SMR04 data

``` r
library(eider)
library(magrittr)
```

This series of vignettes in the *Gallery* section aim to demonstrate the
functionality of `eider` through examples that are similar to real-life
usage. To do this, we have created a series of randomly generated
datasets that are stored with the package. You can access these datasets
using the
[`eider_example()`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/eider/docs/reference/eider_example.md)
function, which will return the path to where the dataset is stored in
your installation of R.

``` r
smr04_data_filepath <- eider_example("random_smr04_data.csv")

smr04_data_filepath
#> [1] "/tmp/RtmpiKfwzZ/temp_libpath357d1cc17fe3/eider/extdata/random_smr04_data.csv"
```

## The data

In this specific vignette, we are using simulated [SMR04
data](https://publichealthscotland.scot/services/national-data-catalogue/smr-data-manual/definitions-by-smr-record-section/smr04-mental-health-inpatient-and-day-case/general-definitions/).
Our dataset does not contain every column specified in here, but serves
as a useful example of how real-life data may be treated using `eider`.

``` r
smr04_data <- utils::read.csv(smr04_data_filepath) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    admission_date = lubridate::ymd(admission_date),
    discharge_date = lubridate::ymd(discharge_date)
  )

dplyr::glimpse(smr04_data)
#> Rows: 217
#> Columns: 7
#> $ id                 <int> 1, 3, 3, 3, 11, 11, 2, 19, 19, 19, 16, 16, 4, 4, 16…
#> $ admission_date     <date> 2015-07-15, 2016-05-03, 2016-05-04, 2016-05-05, 20…
#> $ discharge_date     <date> 2015-07-15, 2016-05-04, 2016-05-05, 2016-05-06, 20…
#> $ cis_marker         <int> 26, 20, 20, 20, 33, 33, 56, 70, 70, 70, 59, 59, 67,…
#> $ episode_within_cis <int> 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, …
#> $ admission_type     <int> 34, 19, NA, NA, 12, NA, 34, 40, NA, NA, 11, NA, 20,…
#> $ specialty          <chr> "G22", "G61", "G21", "G4", "G63", "G6", "G22", "G1"…
```

(Note that when the data is loaded by `eider`, the date columns are
automatically converted to the date type for you: you do not need to do
the manual processing above.)

Each row in this table corresponds to one *episode*; multiple episodes
may be associated with the same *stay*. This simplified table has 7
columns:

- `id`, which is a numeric patient ID;
- `admission_date` and `discharge_date`, which are the dates of
  admission and discharge for each episode;
- `cis_marker`, which is a unique number associated with each stay (note
  that this is not necessarily unique for different patient IDs);
- `episode_within_cis`, which is the episode number within each stay;
  and
- `specialty`, which is the specialty code for the episode.

## Feature 1: Number of episodes associated with a psychotherapy specialty

We begin with a simple example: counting the number of episodes
(i.e. number of rows) associated with a psychotherapy specialty, which
corresponds to any of the codes `"G6"`, `"G61"`, `"G62"`, or `"G63"`.
This is a fairly straightforward `count` transformation_type, with a
filter to select for those values. We can, in principle, express this as
a compound filter with type `"or"`, as the following shows:

``` json
{
  "filter": {
    "type": "or",
    "subfilter": {
      "g6": {
        "column": "specialty",
        "type": "in",
        "value": "G6"
      },
      "g61": {
        "column": "specialty",
        "type": "in",
        "value": "G61"
      },
      "g62": {
        "column": "specialty",
        "type": "in",
        "value": "G62"
      },
      "g63": {
        "column": "specialty",
        "type": "in",
        "value": "G63"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

However, for filters with type `"in"`, `eider` lets the user specify
multiple values to compare against, which is much more compact. The
resulting feature definition is as follows:

``` r
pt_episodes_filepath <- eider_example("psychotherapy_episodes.json")
writeLines(readLines(pt_episodes_filepath))
#> {
#>   "source_table": "smr04",
#>   "transformation_type": "count",
#>   "grouping_column": "id",
#>   "absent_default_value": 0,
#>   "output_feature_name": "num_psychotherapy_episodes",
#>   "filter": {
#>     "column": "specialty",
#>     "type": "in",
#>     "value": [
#>       "G6",
#>       "G61",
#>       "G62",
#>       "G63"
#>     ]
#>   }
#> }
```

``` r
res <- run_pipeline(
  data_sources = list(smr04 = smr04_data_filepath),
  feature_filenames = pt_episodes_filepath
)

dplyr::glimpse(res$features)
#> Rows: 20
#> Columns: 2
#> $ id                         <int> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1…
#> $ num_psychotherapy_episodes <int> 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 6, 4, 3, 9…
```

## Feature 2: Number of stays associated with a psychotherapy specialty

Next, we will count the number of *stays* associated with a
psychotherapy specialty. This is slightly more complicated, as each row
corresponds to an episode, not a stay: thus, we cannot simply count the
number of rows in the table. Instead, we will need to count the number
of unique `cis_marker` values associated with a psychotherapy specialty,
as each `cis_marker` corresponds to a different stay. This means a
transformation type of `"nunique"`, and an aggregation column of
`"cis_marker"`.

``` r
pt_stays_filepath <- eider_example("psychotherapy_stays.json")
writeLines(readLines(pt_stays_filepath))
#> {
#>   "source_table": "smr04",
#>   "transformation_type": "nunique",
#>   "grouping_column": "id",
#>   "absent_default_value": 0,
#>   "aggregation_column": "cis_marker",
#>   "output_feature_name": "num_psychotherapy_stays",
#>   "filter": {
#>     "column": "specialty",
#>     "type": "in",
#>     "value": [
#>       "G6",
#>       "G61",
#>       "G62",
#>       "G63"
#>     ]
#>   }
#> }
```

``` r
res <- run_pipeline(
  data_sources = list(smr04 = smr04_data_filepath),
  feature_filenames = pt_stays_filepath
)

dplyr::glimpse(res$features)
#> Rows: 20
#> Columns: 2
#> $ id                      <int> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, …
#> $ num_psychotherapy_stays <int> 2, 4, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 1…
```

## Interlude: Adding data sources on-the-fly

The last three features will be concerned with the number of days spent
in hospital. In principle, this can be easily calculated from the data
we already have: by taking the discharge date and subtracting the
admission date, we can obtain the length of each episode.

`eider` does not yet possess the functionality to preprocess tables in
this way (by adding new columns). However, the package *does* allow you
to perform this calculation yourself (e.g. using `dplyr`), and then add
the new table to the pipeline as a new data source. Specifically, data
sources do not necessarily need to be CSV filenames; they can simply be
data frames themselves.

Let’s construct this new data frame:

``` r
smr04_with_days_data <- smr04_data |>
  dplyr::mutate(days_in_hospital = as.numeric(discharge_date - admission_date))

dplyr::glimpse(smr04_with_days_data)
#> Rows: 217
#> Columns: 8
#> $ id                 <int> 1, 3, 3, 3, 11, 11, 2, 19, 19, 19, 16, 16, 4, 4, 16…
#> $ admission_date     <date> 2015-07-15, 2016-05-03, 2016-05-04, 2016-05-05, 20…
#> $ discharge_date     <date> 2015-07-15, 2016-05-04, 2016-05-05, 2016-05-06, 20…
#> $ cis_marker         <int> 26, 20, 20, 20, 33, 33, 56, 70, 70, 70, 59, 59, 67,…
#> $ episode_within_cis <int> 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, …
#> $ admission_type     <int> 34, 19, NA, NA, 12, NA, 34, 40, NA, NA, 11, NA, 20,…
#> $ specialty          <chr> "G22", "G61", "G21", "G4", "G63", "G6", "G22", "G1"…
#> $ days_in_hospital   <dbl> 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 1, 0, …
```

In the subsequent sections, we’ll provide this new data frame as a data
source to
[`run_pipeline()`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/eider/docs/reference/run_pipeline.md).

## Feature 3: Total number of days spent in hospital

With this new column, we can now calculate the total number of days each
patient has spent in hospital. This just requires a `sum`
transformation, where we act on the column that we just added, called
`days_in_hospital`.

``` r
total_days_filepath <- eider_example("days_in_smr04.json")
writeLines(readLines(total_days_filepath))
#> {
#>   "source_table": "smr04_with_days",
#>   "transformation_type": "sum",
#>   "grouping_column": "id",
#>   "absent_default_value": 0,
#>   "aggregation_column": "days_in_hospital",
#>   "output_feature_name": "total_days_in_hospital"
#> }
```

Notice that the feature above specifies a different `"source_table"`.
This new identifier can then be passed to
[`run_pipeline()`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/eider/docs/reference/run_pipeline.md),
together with the data frame that we calculated above.

``` r
res <- run_pipeline(
  data_sources = list(smr04_with_days = smr04_with_days_data),
  feature_filenames = total_days_filepath
)

dplyr::glimpse(res$features)
#> Rows: 20
#> Columns: 2
#> $ id                     <int> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 1…
#> $ total_days_in_hospital <dbl> 6, 15, 6, 8, 13, 5, 12, 9, 3, 7, 7, 7, 11, 6, 1…
```

## Feature 4: Longest single stay in hospital

In this feature, we are going to calculate the longest single stay in
hospital for each patient. To do this, we need to add up the number of
days spent in each episode within the same stay, before we take the
maximum of these values.

Because the overall action is to take the maximum, the `max`
transformation type is appropriate here. However, the summation must be
accomplished through a preprocessing step. In this step, we need to
group the data on the `id` and `cis_marker` columns, and then replace
the values of `days_in_hospital` with the sums of the days for all
episodes. This will give us a table where each row still corresponds to
an episode, but the `days_in_hospital` column has been modified to
contain values for each stay.

For more details on preprocessing, see the [corresponding
vignette](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/eider/docs/articles/preprocessing.md).

``` r
longest_stay_filepath <- eider_example("longest_stay.json")
writeLines(readLines(longest_stay_filepath))
#> {
#>   "source_table": "smr04_with_days",
#>   "transformation_type": "max",
#>   "grouping_column": "id",
#>   "absent_default_value": 0,
#>   "preprocess": {
#>     "on": [
#>       "id",
#>       "cis_marker"
#>     ],
#>     "replace_with_sum": [
#>       "days_in_hospital"
#>     ]
#>   },
#>   "aggregation_column": "days_in_hospital",
#>   "output_feature_name": "longest_stay"
#> }
```

``` r
res <- run_pipeline(
  data_sources = list(smr04_with_days = smr04_with_days_data),
  feature_filenames = longest_stay_filepath
)

dplyr::glimpse(res$features)
#> Rows: 20
#> Columns: 2
#> $ id           <int> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,…
#> $ longest_stay <dbl> 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 1, 3, 5, 3, 6, 4, 4, 3, 7, 7, 7, 6
```

## Putting it all together

Just for good measure, let’s run the entire pipeline with all four of
the features above in one go.

``` r
res <- run_pipeline(
  data_sources = list(
    smr04 = smr04_data_filepath,
    smr04_with_days = smr04_with_days_data
  ),
  feature_filenames = c(
    pt_episodes_filepath,
    pt_stays_filepath,
    total_days_filepath,
    longest_stay_filepath
  )
)

dplyr::glimpse(res$features)
#> Rows: 20
#> Columns: 5
#> $ id                         <int> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1…
#> $ num_psychotherapy_episodes <int> 3, 5, 2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 6, 4, 3, 9…
#> $ num_psychotherapy_stays    <int> 2, 4, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 6…
#> $ total_days_in_hospital     <dbl> 6, 15, 6, 8, 13, 5, 12, 9, 3, 7, 7, 7, 11, …
#> $ longest_stay               <dbl> 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 1, 3, 5, 3, 6, 4, 4…
```
