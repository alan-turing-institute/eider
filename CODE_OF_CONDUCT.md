## Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a project
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as
fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a member has made a mistake, we
expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do
our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination
based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with
any visible or invisible disabilities.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
