## Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a
project for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat
everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a member has
made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone
has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen
carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity
in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity,
language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race,
religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical
ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the
protected characteristics above, including participants with any visible
or invisible disabilities.
